This little program deletes some users' messages from a Discord channel.

I used it so Discord wouldn't have an archive of my old chats. Who can say
whether they actually delete them server-side, though!

## Server-side setup

Discord does not let software act on behalf of a user directly,
but instead allows software to show up as "bots". You then must be a server
admin to be able to grant the bot user access to delete your messages.

1. Create a Discord "app" via the
   [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Installation
   1. Check "guild install", uncheck "user install"
   2. Set "install link" to none, required to make it private.
3. OAuth2
   1. Copy the "client id" for use below.
4. Bot
   1. Add Bot.
   2. Reset Token, then save the generated token for use below.
   3. Uncheck "public bot".

### Installing

We need an authorize link with the right permissions:

- View Channels
- Manage Messages
- Read Message History

Via the docs this appears to be a URL like:

https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1411102050267435050&scope=bot&permissions=74752

Where client_id comes from above, and the permissions number is generated by twiddling the
permissions checkboxes on the Bot page.

## Client-side execution

```
$ go build .
$ ./discord-clean -token="$TOKEN"
```
